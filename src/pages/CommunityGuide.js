                      Join us in building a community where people feel welcomed
                      and can participate, regardless of their expertise or

                      be respectful when interacting with other members of the
                      community and our moderating team.

                      1. All content on letsupgrade.in/community should be
                      written in English. 2. Be kind, patient, and welcoming. If
                      you see someone struggling or in need of help, support
                      them. It may be hard for new users to get acquainted and
                      become a part of the community 3. Be respectful to other
                      members and do not insult others or use obscene language.
                      4. No spamming. Do not clutter the boards with off-topic
                      posts. We will modify or delete posts that don't add value
                      to the discussion. 5. This site uses post-moderation (as
                      opposed to pre-moderation), which enables fast
                      communication. As a result, posts may occasionally appear
                      that are later deleted. This is a necessary feature of
                      sites that do not moderate or otherwise set up barriers in
                      advance in order to handle a small subset of inappropriate
                      posts. 6. Users of this Community are encouraged to fill
                      out real-name, detailed professional profiles. This
                      promotes members' work, helps networking and career
                      development, and puts discussions in a meaningful
                      perspective. Impersonation or having multiple accounts on
                      the forum is not allowed. 7. Our points system is meant to
                      reward the community members for sharing questions and
                      answers, so creating multiple accounts or posting content
                      for the sole purpose of gaining points or soliciting
                      others for points is not permitted. Posting filler answers
                      to a question in an effort to be first to answer, or
                      copying and pasting other members' answers, are also forms
                      of inappropriate means. 8. LetsUpgrade Community trademark
                      and logo is the property of LetsUpgrade India. A person or
                      company should never use this trademark or logo without
